# NLIST2017 Submission

This repo contains the code for our experiments done as a part of the [Native Language Identification shared task 2017](https://sites.google.com/site/nlisharedtask/home). This code is here for archival reasons and replication purposes. We worked with the dataset from ETS shared as a part of the task. While we are not allowed to use the dataset beyond this task, a part of this data is available from LDC as ["ETS corpus of non-native written English"](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014T06).

More details about our experiments can be read at: [Link to the paper]()
